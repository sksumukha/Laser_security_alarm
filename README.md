# Laser_security_alarm
This project deals with a design model of a laser security alarm system. There is a laser diode that produces a laser beam that continuously hits a light-dependent  resistive sensor. When the path of laser is blocked from reaching the LDR, causing the sensor to produce a low signal; turns the alarm on.
